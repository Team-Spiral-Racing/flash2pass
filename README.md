# flash2pass
The flash2pass system enables rapidly flashing lights on your car to alert drivers in front of you. This was inspired by cars in endurance racing and is intended to be used on the track. This system was developed with an S2000 in mind but can be applied to any car that has a wired switch for highbeam or headlight on.
